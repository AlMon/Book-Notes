# Chapter 9 - Pragmatic Projects:

- As soon as you have more than one person working on a project, you need to establish some ground rules and delegate parts of the project accordingly.
- The purpose of a software development method is to help people work together.
- Success is in the eye of the beholder —the sponsor of the project.
- Sign your work, and take pride in what you do.
- There are advantages to being a pragmatic individual, but these advantages are multiplied if the individual is working on a pragmatic team.
- A pragmatic team is small, under 10-12 or so members. Members come and go rarely.
- Maintain small, stable teams.
- Quality is a team issue.
- Quality is built in, not bolted on.
- Teams that want to succeed need to consider their knowledge and skill investments as well.
- Trying to get things done “whenever there’s a free moment” means they will never happen.
- Too many teams are so busy bailing out water that they don’t have time to fix the leak. Schedule it. Fix it.
- Don’t adopt new tech, frameworks, or libraries just because “everyone is doing it.” What some people call "Shiny Object Syndrome."
- If your team wants to try out a new technology, put tasks on the schedule to them and analyze results.
- The team as an entity needs to communicate clearly with the rest of the world.
- Great project teams have a distinct personality.
- There is a simple marketing trick that helps teams communicate as one: generate a brand.
- You should be able to ask a question of team members and get a more-or-less instant reply.
- Maintain awareness to stay DRY.
- Build teams so you can build code end-to-end, incrementally and iteratively.
- A great way to ensure both consistency and accuracy is to automate everything the team does.
- Automation is an essential component of every project team.
- Give each member the ability to shine in their own way.
- Imitating the form, but not the content is what anthropologists call a cargo cult.
- By investing in and building up the easily-visible artifacts, you hope to attract the underlying, working magic.
- Do what works, not what's fashionable.
- One size fits no one well.
- You want to take the best pieces from any particular methodology and adapt them for use.
- The goal of course isn’t to “do Scrum,” “do agile,” “do Lean,” or what-have-you. The goal is to be in a position to deliver working software that gives the users some new capability at a moment’s notice.
- Deliver when users need it.
- Overly investing in any particular methodology can leave you blind to alternatives.
- A Pragmatic Methodology has three base components: Version Control, Regression Testing and Full Automation.
- Use Version Control to drive builds, tests, and releases.
- Test early, test often, test automatically.
- A good project may well have more test code than production code.
- Test state coverage, not code coverage.
- Find bugs only once. If a bug slips through the net of existing tests, you need to add a new test to trap it next time.
- Don't use manual procedures, become dependent on automation.
- Our goal as developers is to delight users.
- Delivering working software in a timely manner isn’t enough. That alone won’t delight them.
- Users' expectations are not software related.
- Ask this question: how will we know that we’ve all been successful a month (or a year, or whatever) after this project is done?
- Delight users, don't just deliver code.
- One way to delight your client, forge a relationship with them where you can actively help solve their problems.
- That’s what we do, and that’s the essence of a Pragmatic Programmer. We solve problems.
- Artisans of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.
- Your signature should come to be recognized as an indicator of quality.
