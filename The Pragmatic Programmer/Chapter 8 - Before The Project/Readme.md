# Chapter 8 - Before The Project:

- Even though the Agile Manifesto begins with "individuals and interactions over processes and tools,” virtually all “agile” projects begin with an ironic discussion of which process and which tools they’ll use.
- No method can replace thinking.
- Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.
- No one knows exactly what they want.
- Programmers help people understand what they want.
- A good developer learns to be diplomatic.
- Requirements are a process and they are learned in the feedback loop, not in a vacuum.
- Your job is to help the client understand the consequences of their stated requirements.
- Do that by generating feedback, and letting them use that feedback to refine their thinking.
- Pragmatic Programmers rely on the “is this what you meant?” school of feedback. We produce mockups and prototypes, and let the client play with them.
- The reality is that all of the work we do is actually some form of mockup. Even at the end of the project.
- Look at all of the project as a requirements gathering exercise and work in short iterations.
- Walking in your client's shoes can be an excellent tool to discover new insights.
- Work with the user to think like the user.
- Policy is metadata.
- Successful tools adapt to the hands that use them.
- Let your clients say “yes, it does what I want, but not how I want.”
- You can't get away without documenting your understanding of what the client wants, but don't get too big or exotic about it.
- The requirements document is written for developers, and contains information and subtleties that are sometimes incomprehensible and frequently boring to the client.
- Favor something that can fit on a real (or virtual) index card. These short descriptions are often called user stories.
- Good requirements are abstract and not overtly specific.
- Requirements are not architecture, they are not design, nor are they the user interface. Requirements are need.
- Use a project glossary and make it widely accessible.
- It’s hard to succeed on a project if users and developers call the same thing by different names or, even worse, refer to different things by the same name.
- The secret to solving a puzzle is to identify the real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein.
- Don't think outside the box, find the box instead.
- When faced with an intractable problem, enumerate all the possible avenues you have before you. Don’t dismiss anything, no matter how unusable or stupid it sounds.
- When it comes to observation, fortune favors the prepared mind.
- A great way to feed your brain is to give it feedback on what works and what doesn’t work as you do your daily job.
- Ask questions and have discussions while you’re actually coding.
- Conway’s Law: Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
- There are many benefits to pair programming and mob programming. Different people bring different backgrounds and experience to the table.
- The inherent peer-pressure of a second person helps against moments of weakness and bad habits of naming variables foo and such.
- As with all collaboration, you need to manage the human aspects of it as well as the technical.

### Pragmatic Pair Programming Tips:

- [ ] Build the code, not your ego. It’s not about who’s brightest; we all have our moments, good and bad.
- [ ] Start small. Mob with only 4-5 people, or start with just a few pairs, in short sessions.
- [ ] Criticize the code, not the person. “Let’s look at this block” sounds much better than “you’re wrong.”
- [ ] Listen and try to understand others’ viewpoints. Different isn’t wrong.
- [ ] Conduct frequent retrospectives to try and improve for next time.

- Agility is your style, not you.
- Whenever someone says “do this, and you’ll be agile,” they are wrong. By definition.
- Agility is all about responding to change.

### Pragmatic Programmer Agility Suggestions:

- [ ] **1.** Work out where you are.
- [ ] **2.** Make the smallest meaningful step towards where you want to be.
- [ ] **3.** Evaluate where you end up, and fix anything you broke.

- Repeat these steps until you’re done.

- A team that doesn’t continuously experiment with their process is not an agile team.
- To be able to adjust, at every level, without any hesitation. That is agility.
