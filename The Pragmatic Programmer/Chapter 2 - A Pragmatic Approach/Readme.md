# Chapter 2 - A Pragmatic Approach:

- Good design is easier to change than bad design.
- A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it.
- ETC: Easier To Change. Try to make what you write replaceable.
- Maintenance is not a discrete activity, but a routine part of the entire dev process.
- When we duplicate, we invite a maintenance nightmare.
- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, authoritative representations within a system.
- Dry is about the duplication of knowledge and of intent.
- Not all code duplication is knowledge duplication.
- Setting up a DRY-check channel of communication can alleviate interdeveloper duplication.
- Appoint a team member as the project librarian, to facilitate the exchange of knowledge.
- Make it easy to reuse or people won't use it.
- Minimize secondary effects by decoupling.
- Design components that are self-contained: independent, with a single well-defined purpose.
- Don't rely on the properties of thing you can't control.
- The Decorator Pattern: add functionality to things without changing them.
- When writing documentation, focus on the content.
- Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have.
- Reversibility is important as we don't always make the best decisions the first time around.
- You can't plan for architectural volatility.
- Break your code into components, even if you end up deploying on a single server.
- Forgo following fads.
- Look for the important requirements, the defining ones.
- Don't specify to death.
- Look for areas of doubts and risks, then make those the first areas to code.
- A project is never finished.
- Tracer code is one level above prototyping.
- Prototype code is disposable, tracer code is meant to be for keeps.
- Prototypes are designed to answer just a few questions.
- Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value is not the code, but the lessons learned.
- Always define prototypes as such, don't let anybody think that they can be completed or deployed.
- The limits of language are the limits of one's world.
- To some extent all answers are estimates. Some are just closer to target.
- When it comes to estimating, start by asking if they need high accuracy or ballpark figures.
- Scale estimates as follows: 1 - 15 days / 3 - 6 weeks / 8 - 20 weeks / 20+ weeks
- Choose the unit of your answer to reflect the accuracy intended.
- Record your estimates and keep track of them. If you break, find out why.
- Estimate in a range of scenarios accounting for different variables.
- The best answer when asked for an estimate: "I'll get back to you". Analyze then communicate.
- Create 3 estimates: optimistic, most likely and pessimistic.
- Communicate the pessimistic and gun for optimistic.
