The computer is not like us, it’s more of a tiny projection of what the human mind is like. A projection of the portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.

Programming is more adequate for when tasks are open-ended or unique. Programming is the art and science of construction programs by giving the computer a ser of precise instructions telling it what to do.

Computers are dumb, pedantic beasts and programming itself is tedious and frustrating by its very nature. Computer can only do things that are stupidly straightforward. You should be able to get over that fact, accept it and use it as an advantage.

Programming gives us the freedom to complete tasks in seconds that would take eons to perform manually. Programming also gives us the ability to make the computer do something that it could not do before.

A programming language is an abstraction that is artificially constructed and works as a way to give the instructions to the computers. Much like human languages, computer languages give us the chance to combine words and phrases in new ways to convey new concepts.

Before the UIs of today, BASIC and DOS prompts were the primary way to communicate with computers. Less freedom but more ease of learning is the compromise that is made when we use modern UIs.

Programming is hard. The rules and simple and clear, but the programs that are built on top of programming languages tend to become complex and hard to read over time. In a way we’re constructing our own mazes and we could always get lost in them.

At the end of the day, a program is many things, but fundamentally it is a piece of text written that controls the actions performed inside a computer.

**A program is a building of thought**. It doesn’t cost anything to build, it is weightless and it grows by the sheer force of our typing hands.

A computer on the other hand, serves as the host of these immaterial machinations.

Programs always require care, because without it they will rapidly grow over complex and just out of control. Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming and the main skill of programming is to control complexity.

A great program is simple in its complexity.

So-called “best practices” are boring and ineffective. New programs require new solutions and the approaches can vary just as much. Making mistakes in programming is a good way to understand them.

The charm and power of programming languages comes in large part from them taking care of the uninteresting details for us.

JavaScript and Java have almost nothing to do with each other. The name was decided upon based on marketing considerations and not good judgement.

The ECMAScript standard was set up so that different browsers actually spoke the same language rather than similar but different abstractions.

JavaScript often gets a bad rap and for the first couple of decades or so of its existence that rap as justified. One of the most often cited complaints is how many things JavaScript assumed for us. Its eagerness to accept almost any input and wanting to return what it thought we wanted was apparent.

The modern uses of JavaScript go far beyond the browser. As an example there are databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB that use JavaScript as their scripting and query language. Server programming is now possible through Node.js and Deno.

Code is text and it is what makes up programs. Out building of thought are brought to life via textual instructions.
